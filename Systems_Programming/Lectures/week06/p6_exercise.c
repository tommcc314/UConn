/* Write a program that does the following:
 * The parent program forks a child process that loads an executable sqr.
    * The sqr program computes the square of all numbers between 1 to n (passed as cmd line argument), and prints it on the stdout.
 * The parent process waits for the child process to finish, reaps it and then dies.
