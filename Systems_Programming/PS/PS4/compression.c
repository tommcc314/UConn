    Suppose the compressed string consists of m bits. To make things simple, we'll use an array of char, 
    where each element stores a bit (as either 0 or 1). So, for example, suppose we had the
    following binary codes for the characters A, B and C:

    A: 0
    B: 10
    C: 11
    
    And the string ABAC. We would need 1 bit for each A, 2 bits for
    each B, and 2 bits for each C. For the string, it's a total of 1 +
    2 + 1 + 2 = 6 bits. So, numBits would be set to 6, and we would
    allocate space for 6 characters. And, *bits = {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1}.

    This array (and its length) get put into a BitStream struct, which is defined in compression.h. 
    The countBits function returns the number of char you need to allocate for this array.
