## Prototype Pattern

A prototype provides a method to clone an object. This is useful when object creation is computationally expensive. In this example, the Students class returns a list of students which may be called by other classes to generate data points. If the students are retrieved from a database, then creating a new object from scratch every time would require data to be pulled from the database. However, if the same roster is going to be used for different purposes, then it would be better to have a method to generate a new Students object based on an existing one containing the same data. The clone method creates a copy of the roster list and returns an object identical to the original. Copying a list is much less expensive than retrieving data from a database.
